*(Note: The projects listed above correspond to various days of the challenge. I will update this table as I organize the files into their specific days!)*

## 💡 Goals
1.  **Consistency**: Code every single day.
2.  **Portfolio**: Build a library of tangible projects.
3.  **Mastery**: Deep dive into Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and automation tools.
